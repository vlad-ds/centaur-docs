# SQL Basics for Data Engineering

SQL is the foundation of data engineering. This guide focuses on BigQuery SQL, but the concepts apply broadly.

## Core Concepts

### Basic Queries
```sql
SELECT 
  column1,
  column2,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM `project.dataset.table`
WHERE column1 = 'value'
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

### Joins

```sql
SELECT 
  t1.column1,
  t2.column2
FROM `project.dataset.table1` t1
JOIN `project.dataset.table2` t2
ON t1.column1 = t2.column1
```

### Window Functions

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### Subqueries

### Data Types and Constraints
